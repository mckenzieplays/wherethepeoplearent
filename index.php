    <h1>Let it be wild.</h1>
    <p>A wilderness signifies what is little inhabited and cultivated, 
      and also signifies what is not at all inhabited and cultivated, and is thus 
      used in a twofold sense. Where it signifies what is little inhabited and 
      cultivated, or where there are few habitations, folds of flocks, pastures, 
      and waters, it signifies what has relatively little life and light--as what 
      is spiritual, or those who are spiritual, in comparison with what is celestial, 
      or those who are celestial. but where it signifies what is not inhabited or 
      cultivated at all, or where there are no habitations, folds of flocks, pastures, 
      or waters, it signifies those who are in vastation as to good and in desolation 
      as to truth.</p>
